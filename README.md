# sierra-joyplot

This repository contains code for a webpage showing a ridgeline (joy) plot inspired 3D ridge map of the Sierra Nevada.  The webpage can be visited here:

## Background
In 1970, Harold Craft, Jr. published his PhD thesis titled “Radio Observations of the Pulse Profiles and Dispersion Measures of Twelve Pulsars.”  In his thesis, he published a plot of subpulse signals from pulsar CP1919 - the first radio pulsar ever discovered (by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967).  His plot would later be published by Scientific American and eventually be popularized by the band Joy Division, which used the plot as the album cover for their 1979 album Unknown Pleasures.  The album art became a classic, so much so that overlaid ridgeline plots became known as 'joy plots'.  For more information, check out the Scientific American blog article:

## Code
The basic code for this ridgeline plot was copied from a [project](https://github.com/RalucaNicola/JSAPI_demos/blob/master/ridgeline-3D/index.html) by ESRI product engineer and cartographer [Raluca Nicola](https://raluca-nicola.net/).

The code has been modified so that, instead of Switzerland, the ridgeline plot shows elevation along lines of latitude in the Sierra Nevada in California.
